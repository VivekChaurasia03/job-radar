We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic&#39;s Reinforcement Learning organization leads the research and development that trains Claude to be capable, reliable, and safe. We&#39;ve contributed to every Claude model, with significant impacts on the autonomy and coding capabilities of our most advanced models. Our work spans developing systems that enable models to use computers effectively, advancing code generation through reinforcement learning, pioneering fundamental RL research for large language models, and building scalable training methodologies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The RL org is organized around four key goals: solving the science of long-horizon tasks and continual learning, scaling RL data and environments to be comprehensive and diverse, automating software engineering end-to-end, and training the frontier production model. We collaborate closely with Anthropic&#39;s alignment and safety teams to ensure our systems are both capable and safe.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our engineering teams build the environments, evaluation systems, data pipelines, and tooling that make all of this possible: from realistic agentic training environments and scalable code data generation, to human data collection platforms and production training operations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Full-Stack Software Engineer within Reinforcement Learning, you&#39;ll build the platforms, tools, and interfaces that power RL environment creation, data collection, and training observability.

You&#39;ll own product surfaces end-to-end \u2014 from backend services and APIs to web UIs that internal researchers, external vendors, and data labelers rely on daily. You don&#39;t need a background in ML research \u2014 what matters is strong full-stack engineering skills and the ability to build polished, reliable products in a fast-moving environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You&#39;ll Do:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Build and extend web platforms for RL environment creation, management,

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In case you hadn\u2019t noticed, Anthropic is growing fast. Really, really fast. The People Products team exists to support Anthropic\u2019s mission by defining the blueprint for AI at work. We help hire the best person in the world for every job, ensure manager effectiveness, ramp new hires successfully, and ensure that we apply first principles thinking in how we shape Anthropic\u2019s culture through the tools we build. We cover the entire employee lifecycle from hiring to onboarding, teamwork, and promotions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You\u2019ll work directly with Claude, with access to capabilities no external team has, on problems that are genuinely unsolved. You\u2019ll move fast \u2014 prototype to production in days or weeks. We believe in cross-functional thinkers who can reason across product, design, and engineering. You\u2019ll be given high autonomy, own your decisions, and ship constantly. If you\u2019ve experienced the pain of bad people practices and want to be the person who fixes them at the most consequential AI company in the world, this is that job.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Build full-stack end-to-end across the People Products portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Design and implement AI-native workflows: build tools, evals, prompts, and products. You\u2019ll help define what is possible in applied AI for people processes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Work directly with internal stakeholders \u2014 HR teams, recruiters, managers \u2014 to understand problems, gather feedback, and iterate quickly without waiting for requirements to be handed down. No gatekeeping, you are expected to talk to your customers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Make product and architecture decisions independently in a low-structure environment: knowing when to cut scope, when to ship, and when to ask for input.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Contribute ideas for how the team works, what it builds, and where applied AI can have the most leverage in people workflows.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Be a Good Fit If You:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Derive joy from hard work and the act of creation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Have shipped LLM-native features or applications.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are experienced enough to build big features independently, and make great architectural decisions along the way.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are self-sufficient end-to-end: you can go from idea to production without needing a designer, PM, or architect to unblock you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Move fast without cutting corners: you hold a high quality bar and know how to make smart tradeoffs under time pressure.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Engage directly with users and criticism: you\u2019re comfortable talking to internal customers, hearing hard feedback, and incorporating it quickly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are genuinely mission-driven: you care about the intersection of AI and people practices, not just the technical puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are a collaborative, supportive teammate: you bring people along, communicate clearly about tradeoffs, and make the people around you better.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong Candidates May Also Have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Familiarity with MCP (Model Context Protocol) or prior experience building Claude or LLM integrations in production.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Background at an AI-native company or in a product-focused 0-&amp;gt;1 engineering environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience with HR tech platforms such as Greenhouse, Workday, or Rippling.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For sales roles, the range provided is the role\u2019s On Target Earnings (&quot;OTE&quot;) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Annual Salary:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$300,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$405,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;We require at least a Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time.

We\u2019re doing it cross-cloud with a unified platform, serving over 10k customers, processing exabytes of data/day on 15+ million VMs, and growing exponentially.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Delta Live Tables team (DLT) is looking for recent PhD graduates.&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.databricks.com/product/delta-live-tables&quot;&gt; Delta Live Tables&lt;/a&gt; (DLT) makes it easy to build and manage reliable batch and streaming data pipelines that deliver high-quality data on the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.databricks.com/product/data-lakehouse&quot;&gt; Databricks Lakehouse Platform&lt;/a&gt;. DLT helps data engineering teams simplify ETL (extract-transform-load) development and management with declarative pipeline development, automatic data testing, and deep visibility for monitoring and recovery. DLT optimizes pipeline execution by logical optimization through query transformations, and physical optimization such as instance type selection and vertical/horizontal autoscaling.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Moreover, as part of DLT, we have a new catalyst optimization layer, enzyme, designed specifically to speed up the ETL process and make declarative ETL computation possible by incrementally computing and materializing the intermediate results. Enzyme can create and keep up-to-date a materialization of the results of a given query stored in a Delta table. Enzyme does this by using a cost model to choose between a variety of techniques that borrow from traditional literature on the maintenance of materialized views, delta-to-delta streaming, and manual ETL patterns commonly used by our customers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a part of the DLT team, there are opportunities to design and implement in many areas that leapfrog existing systems:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Query compilation and optimization&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Distributed query execution and scheduling&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Vectorized engine execution&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Resource Management&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Transaction coordination&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Efficient storage structures (encoding, indexes)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Automatic physical data optimization&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What We Look For:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;PhD in databases or systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of database systems, storage systems, distributed systems, and performance optimization&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Motivated by delivering customer value and influence&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay Range Transparency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px;&quot;&gt;Databricks is committed to fair and equitable compensation practices.

We do this by building and running the world&#39;s best data and AI infrastructure platform so our customers can use deep data insights to improve their business. Databricks develops and operates one of the largest scale software platforms; the fleet consists of millions of virtual machines, generating terabytes of logs and processing exabytes of data per day. At our scale, we observe cloud hardware, network, and operating system faults, and our software must gracefully shield our customers from any of the above.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a performance engineer, you will work with multiple teams across the company to evaluate the performance of products and features, identify performance bottlenecks, and partner with engineers to solve performance and scalability issues.

You will report directly to the Director of Engineering and have the opportunity to work with a strong team of engineers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The impact you will have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You will identify performance limitations of the entire stack based on telemetry, customer signals, POCs, and benchmarks to result in the best performing system across the industry, when resolved. Impact spans all cloud providers and all major areas.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You will set the performance expectations for all cross-cutting efforts early on through specialized benchmarks capturing the intended customer user journeys, and make sure they are met before deployed to customers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You will understand the performance characteristics of the compute instance types, storage layers, and all cloud services Databricks depends on and deploy solutions to meet the customer demand.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You will work with customers to root cause and reduce performance problems during production, previews, and POCs.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What We Look For:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;PhD in databases or systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of database systems, storage systems, distributed systems, and performance optimization&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Motivated by delivering customer value and influence&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay Range Transparency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px;&quot;&gt;Databricks is committed to fair and equitable compensation practices.

We are developing a powerful and extensible toolkit that our customers can leverage to solve a variety of different problems and workflows. We\u2019ve seen our most sophisticated customers use the product to run global processes across thousands of employees, coordinate precision manufacturing pipelines, and consolidate previously siloed mission-critical data into a single source of truth. The complexity of these use cases requires us to be extremely thoughtful about how we design and implement new functionality in the product and make sure it\u2019s both easy to use and comprehend for our customers and maintainable for us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;As a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Full-Stack, Backend&lt;/strong&gt; engineer at Airtable, you will have the opportunity to work with customers to deeply understand their needs and workflows.

Working with public cloud networking resources provides unique challenges\u2014each cloud models networking very differently, customers can modify resources out-of-band of our orchestration system (\u201cshadow IT operations\u201d), resources can fail in opaque and varied ways outside of our control, etc.. To solve these issues, our orchestration platform must be resilient and scalable, while also affording flexibility to the unique constraints of each cloud. Powering this orchestration framework are a set of Go and Rust-based microservices running in our core data-centers, leveraging Cloudflare\u2019s infrastructure excellence.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are a team of engineers who obsess over building reliable services which leverage Cloudflare\u2019s unique architecture and global network footprint.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can read more about what we work on here:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-magic-cloud-networking&quot;&gt;https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-magic-cloud-networking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a software engineer on the Magic Cloud Networking team, you will contribute to features that shape Cloudflare One\u2019s use of multi-cloud networking.

Today the company runs one of the world\u2019s largest networks that powers millions of websites and other Internet properties for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine\u2019s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World\u2019s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare. Come join us!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Available Locations: London, Lisbon or Austin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;About the team&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are a team of software engineers who build distributed systems critical to keeping Cloudflare\u2019s network operating smoothly and efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We work with the latest Linux network technologies and low-level details of network protocols. But we&#39;re also responsible for sophisticated automated control systems.&amp;nbsp; The code we write runs on thousands of servers in hundreds of data centres around the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As the scale of Cloudflare&#39;s network and the variety of services we offer continue to grow, so do the challenges we tackle.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;What you&#39;ll do&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You\u2019ll participate in the&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/unimog-cloudflares-edge-load-balancer/&quot;&gt; ongoing development of a load distribution system that works&lt;/a&gt; at the scale of Cloudflare\u2019s edge network. Millions of users and customers depend upon this system every hour of every day, even if it isn\u2019t visible to them. You\u2019ll take on challenging projects that require focus and determination, pragmatism and innovation, and careful consideration of risk. You\u2019ll get to know the details of Cloudflare\u2019s software and hardware infrastructure in order to design software that behaves well even when failures occur. You\u2019ll collaborate with engineers across the company, from operations teams to the teams that build our customer-facing products.
